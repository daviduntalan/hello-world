# hello-world
this is my first repository name 'hello-world' from github guides

hello github,

I'm David C. Untalan Jr. and I'm starting to learn how this repository works.
I'm following this tutorial from here: 
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world#introduction

I hope you'll be good to me. 

thanks! :)
